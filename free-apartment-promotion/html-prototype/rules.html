<h1>Giveaway Official Rules</h1>
<p>NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. A PURCHASE WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCE OF WINNING.

Eligibility. Open to individual legal residents of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia who are the older of 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in their state of residence, except that if the total approximate retail value ("ARV") of all prizes in the Sweepstakes exceeds $500.00, individual legal residents of Rhode Island will not be eligible to enter.

The winner selection method will be one of the following, as more fully described on the Sweepstakes Landing Page:

Every [n]th entrant who submits an eligible entry will be a potential winner, while the specified supply of prizes last. Odds of winning are one in every [n]th eligible entries received;
The first [x] number of entrants who submit an eligible entry will be potential winner(s). Odds of winning are dependent on the date, time and number of eligible entries received; or
Entrants who submit an eligible entry will be selected randomly to be potential winner(s). Odds of winning are one in every [n]th eligible entries received.
Potential winner(s) will be selected by random drawing from among all eligible entries received. Odds of winning depend on the number eligible entries received.

Prizes will be shipped by EZ Properities. Winners will be responsible for providing or confirming a valid U.S. shipping address prior to their prize being shipped.

Each winner will be responsible for paying all costs and expenses related to a prize that are not specifically mentioned, including, but not limited to, income taxes, and any other expenses that might reasonably be incurred by the winner in receiving or using the prize. Please consult a tax professional to discuss your particular situation. Each winner may be required to submit his/her social security number or tax payer ID to EZ Properities in order to claim a prize. If a winner does not provide his/her social security number or tax payer ID as requested by EZ Properities, the winner will no longer be eligible to receive the prize and the prize will be forfeited and returned to Sponsor.

Each prize will be awarded "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). If you win a prize, you may not transfer, assign, or redeem the prize for cash. Sponsor or EZ Properities reserve the right to substitute a prize with a gift card or other prize of value equal to or greater than the value paid by Sponsor while setting up the Sweepstakes.

Additional Terms. Sponsor and EZ Properities reserve the right to modify or cancel a Sweepstakes at any time.

Sponsor and EZ Properities are not responsible for: (a) lost, misdirected, late, incomplete, or unintelligible entries or for inaccurate entry information, whether caused by you or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in a Sweepstakes, or by any technical or human error that may occur in the processing of entries; (b) any printing or typographical errors in any materials associated with a Sweepstakes; (c) any error in the operation or transmission, theft, destruction, unauthorized access to, or alteration of, entries, or for technical, network, telephone, computer, hardware or software, malfunctions of any kind, or inaccurate transmission of, or failure to receive any entry information on account of technical problems or traffic congestion on the Internet or at any website; or (d) injury or damage to your or any other computer or device resulting from downloading any materials in connection with a Sweepstakes.
